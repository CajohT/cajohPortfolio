    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Cajoh Thomas's Portfolio</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Hello, my name is Cajoh Thomas, I am from Detroit Michigan, and I am a senior at Renaissance High School. I have a multitude of aspirations for life post high school. For starters, over the summer my goal is to start up my own online bookstore business with the support of my mother to help pay for some of my college fees. In the upcoming fall I will be attending Eastern Michigan University majoring in computer science and minoring in marketing hoping to achieve my undergraduate degree. There I want to branch out and discover new things, meet new people, and join some extracurricular activities. Furthermore, at Eastern Michigan University I am set on maintaining at least a 3.0 grade point average. While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I am aiming to improve my resume with a myriad of different technology and business internships. After completing my undergraduate degree, I aspire to transfer to either University of Michigan or Michigan State to achieve my Graduate degree. With my degree and strong resume, I wish to work at one of the large tech companies such as Facebook or Google. There I will work as a front end or back-end web developer and will ascend into a higher position learning all that I can to be able to break away to become an entrepreneur. I will then become the chief executive officer of my own large technology company building websites. I will help different clients with their front end and back-end website maintenance. Taking everything into account I know that these are some big aspirations, but I know I can do it.
